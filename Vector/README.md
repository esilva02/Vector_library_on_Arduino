# The Vector Library

This library is a basic reimplementation of the C++ vector library for Arduino. Even the names of the methods are the  same as in the C++ library. Additionally, some new methods that differ from the original library, as you can see on the example that comes in this repo, where the 'printVec()' method is an example.
